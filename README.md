Project Title - Insurance Cost Project

Description - Project Scenario
Data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataaset. This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website.

Parameters - The parameters used in the dataset are:

1. Age Age of the insured. Integer quantity.
2. Gender Gender of the insured. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way.
3. 3	Gender	4	Assigned Value
5	Female	6	1
7	Male	8	2
	9	BMI Body Mass Index of the insured. Float value quantity.
1. No_of_Children Number of children the insured person has. Integer quantity.
2. Smoker Whether the insured person is a smoker or not. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way.
12	Smoker	13	Assigned Value
14	Smoker	15	1
16	Non smoker	17	2
	18	Region Which region of the USA does the insured belong to. This parameter has been mapped to numerical values in the following way.
19	Region	20	Assigned Value
21	Northwest	22	1
23	Northeast	24	2
25	Southwest	26	3
27	Southeast	28	4
	29	Charges Charges for the insurance in USD. Floating value quantity.

The project is divided into 5 sections:

* Cleaned the data, taking care of the blank entries.
* Ran exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges.
* Developed single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges.
* Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.


SETUP/INSTALATION - Python 3.5 and above Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, scipy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotplib, Seaborn.
